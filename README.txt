CURRENT TODO:

Fix the networking, going for a dedicated server instead of the current local-only setup.

Chats appear above the respective player's character sprite and also in the text box (both). This should be able to be done with signals and an additional text field which is added to the player_character scene as a child.

Fix the goofy A* path choices

Can I limit the tickrate to something like Runescapes' 4 tps?

Fix collisions -- players occupy their tile entirely, and new players spawn on the nearest onoccupied tile? Or, remove collisions like in games like Runescape.

8-directional sprite movement based on camera orientation and movement direction. Using just dev-sprites (arrows) for now.

Ability to enter display names which show up in Chat and when a player is hovered over/clicked/right-clicked? Just implement Peer ID for now.
