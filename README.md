CURRENT TODO:
- Chats appear above the respective player's character sprite and also in the text box (both). This should be able to be done with signals and an additional text field which is added to the player_character scene as a child.
- Fix the goofy A* pathing choices
- Can I limit the tickrate to something like Runescapes' 4 tps?
- Fix collisions -- players occupy their tile entirely, and new players spawn on the nearest onoccupied tile? Or, remove collisions like in games like Runescape.
- 8-directional sprite movement based on camera orientation and movement direction. Using just dev-sprites (arrows) for now.
- Ability to enter display names which show up in Chat and when a player is hovered over/clicked/right-clicked? Just implement Peer ID for now.
- Add an admin client
- Export Linux server

Future:
- Add basic skills to train
- Add inventory and items, drops, trading
- Add item processing skills
- Develop a proper (early) game world and sprites
- Instances or levels. Dungeon with dungeon enemies that functions as a raid.
- Account creation
- Character creation screen
- Basic NPC shop
- Magic. Most strong healing and support spells are high-level. Damage spells or low level e.g. teleport spells to train.
- Magical items are pre-rendered 3D to give them a striking look

Suggestions: PR onto TODO or suggest on Discord
